# Night Snack Delivery 

A full-stack multi-vendor food delivery web application built for hostel environments using Next.js 14, MongoDB, and NextAuth.js.

## Problem Statement

In our Hostels, ordering snacks late at night can be inconvenient due to lack of a centralized ordering system. Sellers struggle to reach buyers efficiently, and buyers have limited options for quick, hassle-free snack orders.

## Solution

Night Snack Store is a web application designed for hostel students to order snacks easily and for sellers to manage their snack listings per hostel. It supports two hostels â€” Himalaya and Janadhar @Jain University â€” allowing sellers to add products with prices and specify which hostel they serve. Buyers can place orders by selecting their hostel and room number. 

The app uses Google authentication for secure login, and a switch button lets users toggle between buyer and seller roles, as one person can be both. Orders are paid via cash or UPI on delivery, simplifying payment processing.

Built with Next.js, NextAuth for Google sign-in, and a backend to manage products and orders, this app streamlines snack delivery for hostels and improves convenience for all users.
